  &lt;li&gt;“We deserve this Cheese,” Hem said. “We certainly had to work long and hard enough to find it.” He picked up a nice fresh piece and ate it. Afterward, Hem fell asleep, as he often did. Every night the Littlepeople would waddle home, full of Cheese, and every morning they would confidently return for more. This went on for quite some time. After a while Hem’s and Haw’s confidence grew into the arrogance of success. Soon they became so comfortable they didn’t even notice what was happening.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As time went on, Sniff and Scurry noticed the cheese quality was deteriorating over time. One morning they arrived at Cheese Station C and discovered there was no cheese. They weren’t surprised. Since Sniff and Scurry had noticed the supply of cheese had been getting smaller every day, they were prepared for the inevitable and knew instinctively what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To the mice, the problem and the answer were both simple. The situation at Cheese Station C had changed. So, Sniff and Scurry decided to change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hem and Haw arrived at Cheese Station C. They had not been paying attention to the small changes that had been taking place each day, so they took it for granted their Cheese would be there. They were unprepared for what they found. “What! No Cheese?” Hem yelled. He continued yelling, “No Cheese? No Cheese?” as though if he shouted loud enough someone would put it back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For some, finding Cheese was having material things. For others it was enjoying good health or developing a spiritual sense of well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slowly, Haw was beginning to realize the difference between activity and productivity. He had asked himself those same questions too many times and felt the fears again that kept him where he was. He asked himself, “Where am I more likely to find Cheese—here or in the Maze?” He painted a picture in his mind. He saw himself venturing out into the Maze with a smile on his face. While this picture surprised him, it made him feel good. He saw himself getting lost now and then in the Maze, but felt confident he would eventually find New Cheese out there and all the good things that came with it. He gathered his courage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haw smiled. He knew Hem was wondering, “Who moved my cheese?” but Haw was wondering, “Why didn’t I get up and move with the Cheese, sooner?”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you are afraid things are going to get worse if you don’t do something, it can prompt you into action. But it is not good when you are so afraid that it keeps you from doing anything. Haw decided that if he ever got the chance again, he would get out of his comfort zone and adapt to change sooner. It would make things easier. Just when he thought he was getting ahead, he would get lost in the corridors. It seemed his progress was two steps forward and one step backward. It was a challenge, but he had to admit that being back in the Maze, hunting for Cheese, wasn’t nearly as bad as he feared it might be. He was taking control, rather than simply letting things happen to him. Then he reminded himself, if Sniff and Scurry could move on, so could he!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haw realized he had been held captive by his own fear. Moving in a new direction had freed him. Haw realized again, as he had once before, that what you are afraid of is never as bad as what you imagine. The fear you let build up in your mind is worse than the situation that actually exists. His old thinking had been clouded by his worries and fears. He used to think about not having enough Cheese, or not having it last as long as he wanted. He used to think more about what could go wrong than what could go right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He knew that when you change what you believe, you change what you do. You can believe that a change will harm you and resist it. Or you can believe that finding New Cheese will help you and embrace the change. He realized that when he had been afraid to change he had been holding on to the illusion of Old Cheese that was no longer there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You could notice when the little changes began so that you would be better prepared for the big change that might be coming. He knew he needed to adapt faster, for if you do not adapt in time, you might as well not adapt at all. He had to admit that the biggest inhibitor to change lies within yourself, and that nothing gets better until you change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haw thought about going back again to Cheese Station C to see if he could find Hem—assuming that Haw could find his way back there. If he found Hem, he thought he might be able to show him how to get out of his predicament. But Haw realized that he had already tried to get his friend to change. Hem had to find his own way, beyond his comforts and past his fears. No one else could do it for him, or talk him into it. He somehow had to see the advantage of changing himself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Haw still had a great supply of Cheese, he often went out into the Maze and explored new areas to stay in touch with what was happening around him. He knew it was safer to be aware of his real choices than to isolate himself in his comfort zone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“They said holding a picture of New Cheese in their minds—seeing themselves doing well in a new job—made them feel better, and helped them do better in job interviews. Several got better jobs.”&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Then his father realized that even now Siddhartha no longer dwelt with him in his home, that he had already left him. The Father touched Siddhartha’s shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of thirst, empty of wishing, empty of dreams, empty of joy and sorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have never before seen a person glance and smile, sit and walk this way, he thought; truly, I wish to be able to glance and smile, sit and walk this way, too, thus free, thus venerable, thus concealed, thus open, thus child-like and mysterious. Truly, only a person who has succeeded in reaching the innermost part of his self would glance and walk this way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to learn from myself, want to be my student, want to get to know myself, the secret of Siddhartha.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;She taught him, that lovers must not part from one another after celebrating love, without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having been abused.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A frightening emptiness was reflected back at him by the water, answering to the terrible emptiness in his soul.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now Siddhartha also got some idea of why he had fought this self in vain as a Brahman, as a penitent. Too much knowledge had held him back, too many holy verses, too many sacrificial rules, to much self-castigation, so much doing and striving for that goal! Full of arrogance, he had been, always the smartest, always working the most, always one step ahead of all others, always the knowing and spiritual one, always the priest or wise one. Into being a priest, into this arrogance, into this spirituality, his self had retreated, there it sat firmly and grew, while he thought he would kill it by …more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This was among the ferryman’s virtues one of the greatest: like only a few, he knew how to listen. Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience, did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening. Siddhartha felt, what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These people are rare who know how to listen. And I did not meet a single one who knew it as well as you did. I will also learn in this respect from you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of all, he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart, with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without judgement, without an opinion.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Stoicism doesn’t mean repressing emotion and shunning pleasure, I learned, but—in essence—focusing on what is in our power and letting go of everything we can’t control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When practical necessity demands that you desire or avoid something external—at work, for instance—act with steady deliberation, not hasty strain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People who are ignorant of philosophy blame others for their own misfortunes. Those who are beginning to learn philosophy blame themselves. Those who have mastered philosophy blame no one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;So, if you have not been invited to a party, it is because you haven’t paid the price of the invitation. It costs social engagement, conversation, encouragement, and praise. If you are not willing to pay this price, do not be upset when you don’t receive an invitation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whenever misfortune befalls you, ask yourself how you would react if it were someone else in the same situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a feast, taking the largest helping may be good for your appetite, but sharing generously is good for the spirit of the celebration. In this case, honoring your hosts and fellow guests should be valued above sating your hunger.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Care for your body as needed, but put your main energies and efforts into cultivating your mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not proclaim yourself a philosopher, or go around preaching your principles. Show them by example.  At a feast, do not give a speech about how everyone should eat. Only eat as you should.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
