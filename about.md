# About Me

I am Phani Srikanth and I currently work as a Data Scientist at Microsoft India in Hyderabad, India. I specialise in building machine learning solutions. A lot of my work has been around building learning algorithms on structured datasets from databases and extracting useful representations of entities from unstructured datasets such as images and text.
